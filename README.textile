h2. Overview

AvgItemLevel is a World of Warcraft addon that lets you see the effective average ItemLevel (iLevel) of your currently equipped gear. On the bottom right of the Character and Inspect frames you can see the average for yourself or for your inspect target.

If you are setting up raid assignments, however, that can get a bit tedious. To assist with that, you can use the /avgilevel command to bring up the party/raid report window. To report the averages to your group, simply click the "Report" button. A LibDataBroker launcher is also included that when clicked will open the report window.

To automatically equip the highest iLevel piece for the relevant slots, Alt-click the label on the character frame or click the "Equip Best" button on the report window.

No configuration required, just install and go.

h2. How the value is calculated

The value is calculated using the current scaling for iLevel on vehicles like those used in Flame Leviathan and Wintergrasp. This calculation could change in the future.
# 25-man scaling is same as in 10-man.
# Shirt, tabard, offhand, and ranged/relic slots do not affect vehicle scaling
# This does mean an ilvl 226 1 hand weapon is better than an ilvl 213 2 hander
# Enchants and gems do not affect it either, it is based solely off item level
# An ilvl 200 blue is equivalent to an ilvl 187 epic.
# An empty slot is equivalent to an ilvl 0 epic. This does mean equipping an ilvl 0 blue such as Insignia of the Scourge will be worse than having nothing at all in the slot

Additionally the following untested assumptions are made:
# Artifact/heirloom (yellow) and legendary (orange) are the same as Epic (purple).
# Common (white) and Poor (gray) are 0

h2. Impact of Averge ItemLevel on Vehicle Health

# Taking the average ilvl of your gear using the above algorithm and subtracting 170 will give you the aproximate percent increase to the health of your vehicle.
# Thus: All ilvl 200 epic gear => 200-170 => 30% increase in vehicle hp. All 226 would be a 56% increase.
